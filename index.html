          I think you’ve got to assume that their contract status is (their status) until we do differently. Those guys … are still under contract. There are others that are under contract. There are others that are not. The real world is since I haven’t, we haven’t, addressed this thing is whatever their contract status is, and I don’t want to get into what that status is. But whatever it is, it is.

          We want to play football. We have an obligation to everyone, particularly our fans. My gut is we're going to come up with something, but it's still up in the air. It's going to be long and drawn out and tough.

Puddy: Well, you know, support the team. Elaine: It’s very hard being a stand-up comedian. Sometimes they don’t laugh. Jerry: Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason. Jerry: When someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire? Jerry: Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? Jackie Chiles: Rugged? The man’s a goblin.

Jerry: You’re not very bright, are you? George: No I’m not. I would like to be, but I’m not? Kramer: Yamahama, it’s fright night! George: My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter, I was raised to give up. It’s one of the few things I do well! Elaine: Hey Jerry, when do you consider sex has taken place?

          "Wait up!" That's what kids say. They don't say "wait", they say "Wait up! Hey, wait up!" 'Cause when you're little, your life is up. The future is up. Everything you want is up. "Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Mom, I'll clean up! Let me stay up!" Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything is down. "Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here. Sit down. Put that down."

            100,000 Tons of Steel

            I know these rails we're on like I know my lady's smile,
            We see a dozen dreams in every passing mile.
            Can't begin to count the trips she and I have made,
            But I wish I had a dollar for each time we've both been down this grade.

            And 100,000 tons of steel, made to roll.
            The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep, her engine's sure to blow.
            And 100,000 tons of steel, out of control,
            She's more a rollercoaster than the train I used to know.

            It's one hell of an understatement, to say she can't be beat.
            She's tempermental, more a bitch than a machine.
            She wasn't built to travel at speed or through mud slides.
            These wheels are bound to jump the tracks before they burn like the ties

            And 100,000 tons of steel, made to roll.
            The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep, her engine's sure to blow
            And 100,000 tons of steel, out of control
            She's more a rollercoaster than the train I used to know.

            Murphy sure out done himself to pick this stretch of track
            I can only hope my luck is ridin' in the back.
            Well I have pray to God this ain't the day we meet,
            I've done about everything, but try dragging my feet.

            And 100,000 tons of steel, made to roll.
            The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep, her engine's sure to blow
            And 100,000 tons of steel, out of control,
            She's more a rollercoaster than the train I used to know.

            Oh, oh I want to go down slow.

            Truckin'

            Truckin' got my chips cashed in. Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
            Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on.

            Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
            Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
            Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
            Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

            Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans;
            New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be, oh no.

            Most of the cast that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
            Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
            One of these days they know they better get goin'
            Out of the door and down on the streets all alone.

            Truckin', like the do-dah man. Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
            Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay'em down,

            Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
            Other times I can barely see.
            Lately it occurres to me What a long, strange trip it's been.

            What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
            She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
            Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
            All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame?"

            Truckin', up to Buffalo. Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
            Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on.

            Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window.
            Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
            I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
            But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in.

            Busted, down on Bourbon Street, Set up, like a bowlin' pin.
            Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin. They just won't let you be, oh no.

            You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel;
            Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down.
            I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
            Get out of the door and light out and look all around.

            Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
            Other times I can barely see.
            Lately it occurres to me What a long, strange trip it's been.

            Truckin', I'm a goin' home. Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong,
            Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on.
            Hey now get back truckin' home.

            On The Road Again

            Why I married me a bad girl, tell you the reason why
            Bad girls will even do things on the sly
            Look for your supper to be good and hot
            She never even put a stew bone in the pot

            She's on the road again, sure as you're born
            Natural born easy on the road again

            Friend come by, say looking for his hat
            Wants to know where your husband's at
            I don't know, he's on his way to the pen
            Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again

            Went to my house the front door was locked
            Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked
            Jumped right back, shook my head,
            Big old rounder in my folding bed
            Jumped into the window, broke the glass
            Never seen that little rounder run so fast

            Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again
